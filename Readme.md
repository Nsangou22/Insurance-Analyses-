# Insurance Claim Prediction

## 📝 Project Overview
This project predicts the **insurance claim amount** an individual can request based on personal and vehicle data.  
A **Machine Learning regression model** powers the predictions, and a **PyQt GUI** allows users to interact with the model directly and test with sample data.

## ⚙️ Features
- Predicts **claim amounts** using ML regression models.  
- **PyQt GUI** for interactive testing and data input.  
- Provides **sample datasets** for experimentation.  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns in claims.

## 👨‍💻 Models Used

XGBoost Regressor – to capture nonlinear relationships.

Decision Tree Regressor – for interpretable predictions.

Evaluation metrics: R² Score, RMSE, MAE.

## 📊 Insights & Analysis
- Distribution of claim amounts and common patterns.  
- Average claim amount by vehicle type, policy type, and age.  
- Trends and risk factors affecting claim amounts.

## ⚡ Quick Demo
- Open the PyQt application: `python main.py`  
- Explore the model via the Jupyter Notebook: `notebooks/insurance_claim_prediction.ipynb`  
- Test with the included **sample datasets** in `data/`.
